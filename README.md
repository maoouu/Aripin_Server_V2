# Aripin_Server_V2
Aripin's Minecraft community project aiming to make Java and Bedrock cross-playable using GeyserMC!

## FAQs
#### What's with the long absence, Maou?
- Sorry, after taking a few days of suspension, I got bombarded by College work. I'm making this repository so that other people
can take part and continue the project while I'm away.
#### Who is this repository for?
- This repository's for the tech-peeps in the Aripin's discord server who aren't afraid with tinkering config files 
and stuff about Java.
- The server file will be available on the google drive link below.
- I'll try to add a readme file for the important bits in there.
#### When will you come back?
- I've told Whii the circumstances that I'm in, so probably not soon. But I'll definitely be back, don't worry.

## Server Folder Link

## Important Bits
#### Running the server
- You just have to click the `run.bat` file, it has all the optimizations required to run the server smoothly.
- To stop the server, just enter `stop`
#### Versions
- This is just a backup for the previous server.jar versions
#### Server.properties
- `server-ip= <put your host IP or your ZeroTier One IP (if you're planning to use that)>`
#### plugins/Geyser-Spigot/config.yml
- There should be two places where you need to put the same host IP, one for BEDROCK and one for REMOTE
- `address= <the host IP goes here>` 
#### (Optional) ZeroTier One
- If you plan to host your own ZeroTier One virtual network, here's a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTlxwg3atBc
