Aripin's Minecraft community project aiming to make Java and Bedrock cross-playable using GeyserMC!

## FAQs
#### What's with the long absence, Maou?
- Sorry, after taking a few days of suspension, I got bombarded by College work. I'm making this repository so that other people
can take part and continue the project while I'm away.
#### Who is this repository for?
- This repository's for the tech-peeps in the Aripin's discord server who aren't afraid with tinkering config files 
and stuff about Java.
- The server file will be available on the google drive link below.
- I'll try to add a readme file for the important bits in there.
#### When will you come back?
- I've told Whii the circumstances that I'm in, so probably not soon. But I'll definitely be back, don't worry.
